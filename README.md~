Introduction
------------

  The main objective of this software was providing the EIC community users
with a tool, which would allow them to easily (whatever easy means) create possible 
EIC detector configuration *templates* (namely, the self-consistent collections of 
3D sub-detector intergation volumes) and make use of them in the GEANT simulation 
environment.
